## Congrats

Congrats on making it all the way to the end of this super early version of the
book. I'd _really_ love to hear from you!

The current plan for the book is to be a fairly exhaustive resource on how to
practically build a real-world application using Elixir, Phoenix, and Elm. That
likely means writing about 1,000 pages of content before trying to distill that
down into something more useful.

I'll continue building out the demo application and documenting the process as
meticulously as possible. The good news is that it should provide a reproducible
way to build a real application. But it's also really important to me that the
book covers functional concepts in a compelling way that doesn't just feel like
an afterthought.

I'll be working hard on adding a lot of content over the upcoming weeks and
months, but definitely get in touch if you have any of the following ideas:

- functional concepts you'd like covered.
- minigame examples you'd like to see.
- recommendations for tools.
- anything else!

## Slack

As a bonus for purchasing an early copy of the book and making it this far, you
get access to the Slack group! I know I'm part of a million different Slack
communities now, but I'd also like to be able to provide live support for the
book's content in the long run, so this is likely a good place to start. I also
really wanted to provide a place to stop and chat about building and deploying
things. Feel free to stop in and say hello!
