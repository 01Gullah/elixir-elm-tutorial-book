# Elm and API Data

Now that we have our Elm front-end application up and running, let's start
integrating it with our Phoenix application data. To start with, we can focus
on reading the game data from our API and rendering it on the page.

## TODO

- Reading JSON API data from Phoenix.
- Decoding JSON and working with game data in Elm.
- Displaying lists of both games and players.
- Sorting players by score?
- Simple layout design?
- Featured game in header?
