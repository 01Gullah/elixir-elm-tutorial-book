# Elm and API Data

Now that we have our Elm front-end application up and running, let's start
integrating it with our Phoenix application. To start with, we can focus on
reading the game data from our API and rendering it on the page.

## TODO

- Reading JSON API data from Phoenix.
- Decoding JSON and working with game data in Elm.
