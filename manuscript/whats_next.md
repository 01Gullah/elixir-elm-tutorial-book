# What's Next?

The original plan for this book included additional features and more minigame
ideas. However, the priority shifted towards shipping a solid, stable _v1.0_
release instead of an exhaustive resource. Rather than having a dozen
half-written and half-implemented features, the hope is that this release will
be a stable foundational resource.

What features do we have to look forward to for _v2.0_?

## More Minigames

This is the most fun part of the Elixir and Elm Tutorial, and perhaps the
biggest differentiator between this resource and many of the other great
resources available.

- Adventure
- Pong
- Snake

Future versions of this book will most certainly contain additional minigame
chapters. 

- [404 Elm Street](https://github.com/zalando/elm-street-404)
- [Asteroids](https://github.com/justinmimbs/asteroids)
- [Elm Shooter](https://github.com/sporto/elm-shooter)
- [Vessel](https://github.com/slawrence/vessel)

## Multiplayer?

## Game Ideas

The intention for this book is that the games we build should be fun and
interactive. So the focus would be on small classic game genres that involve
keyboard or mouse interaction to move a character around (as opposed to games
like hangman or number guessing or memory games).

The original idea was to implement very small games where players could score
points simply by moving a character around or jumping. But the initial game
grew to increase the fun factor, and the plan is to incorporate quite a few
game elements to make for a slightly more substantial example in a single game.

It would be great to add at least one more game in addition to the initial
example. And the next game would likely incorporate more mouse interaction, so
it could end up being a simple flying/driving game, or potentially be something
more akin to an adventure game where the character can move in more directions.

- [x] Mov-ey: Use keyboard input to move a small character left and right on the
  screen. Increase score as player hits target points?
- [x] Jump-ey: Add ability to make a character jump. Increase score as player jumps
  to target points?
- [x] Platform-ey: Side scroller example inspired by Super Mario Bros.
- [ ] Adventur-ey: Allows player to move up, down, left, and right inspired by The
  Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
- [ ] Driv-ey: A simple driving game similar to the Vessel Elm game example.
- [ ] Asteroids Clone: Old school example inspired by Asteroids for Atari.
