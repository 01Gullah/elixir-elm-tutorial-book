# Elm Minigames

## Game Ideas

- Mov-ey: Use keyboard input to move a small character left and right on the
  screen. Increase score as player hits target points?
- Jump-ey: Add ability to make a character jump. Increase score as player jumps
  to target points?
- Platform-ey: Side scroller example inspired by Super Mario Bros.
- Adventur-ey: Allows player to move up, down, left, and right inspired by The
  Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
- Asteroids: Old school example inspired by Asteroids for Atari.

## Other Game Ideas

Ideally the games will be fun and interactive, but it could be helpful to use
familiar simple games to cover some functional concepts.

- Number Guessing Game: Make guesses to find out number. Useful for covering
  random number generation and binary search algorithms.
- Simon: Classic Simon memory game. Could be useful for covering graphics.
- Conway's Game of Life: Could potentially use the topics in Corey Haines's
  book on simple program design.
