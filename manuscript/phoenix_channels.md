# Phoenix Channels

We created our `ScoreChannel` and set up elm-phoenix-socket in the last
chapter, but we haven't really worked with Phoenix channels much outside of the
initial configuration. In this chapter, we'll take that data from our Elm
front-end game, and find a good way to handle it with our Phoenix back-end.
