## Congrats

Congrats on making it all the way to the end of the book. I'd _really_ love to
hear from you!

We managed to accomplish our goal of building a fun project together and learn
a lot about functional web programming along the way.

## Feedback

Were there additional concepts you'd like to have seen covered in the material?
Were there parts of the book that felt confusing? Was there something we could
have done differently in our approach?

If you have any feedback about the book's content or the demos contained
within, then feel free to reach out.

One simple way to provide feedback is to email the author directly at
`bijanbwb@gmail.com`. Alternatively, feel free to create GitHub issues in
either the book's content repository or the demo repository:

- [Book Content Issues](https://github.com/elixir-elm-tutorial/elixir-elm-tutorial-book/issues)
- [Platform Demo Issues](https://github.com/elixir-elm-tutorial/platform/issues)

## Slack

As a bonus for making it this far, you can access the book's Slack group! I
know there are a million different Slack communities now, but I'd like to be
able to provide live support for the book's content. I also really wanted to
provide a place say hello, get help, and provide suggestions. Get an invite to
the book's Slack channels with the following link:
