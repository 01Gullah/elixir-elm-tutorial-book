# Notes

## Alt Titles

- Building The Next Big Thing with Elixir and Elm!
- Building a Game Platform with Elixir and Elm!
- Building a Scalable Minigame Platform with Elixir and Elm!

## Theme?

- To theme or not to theme?
  - Video game start-up theme: The reader would be a "new hire" at a fictitious
    web start-up, tasked with creating a new platform as the old one falls
    apart.
  - Themeless content: Professional technical book approach with minimal
    theming.

## Why Not Section

- In addition to mentioning why these languages are great, it would be prudent
  to add a section about why some readers would be best to stick with other
  options if they're already happy doing what they're doing.

## Remarkability

- Create your own game section, share results.
- Book-related forum for sharing.
- Twitter sharing links.

## Elm Ideas

- Intro to Elm with static page.
- Create a simple "now" page.
- Deploy live with GitHub pages.

## Tracking Progress

- Work by the clock for writing.
- Engagement: number of readers.
- Revenue: number of purchases.

## Rewriting the "Why?" Sections

Consider rewriting the sections on "Why Elixir?" and "Why Elm?". There are
already good answers to these questions in the existing books on Elixir,
Phoenix, and Elm. It might be worth pointing readers to those resources and
focusing on the simple answers about how Elixir and Phoenix and Elm make
development fun and exciting because we can add features instead of bugs to our
applications. This was mentioned in my original [presentation on
Elm](https://prezi.com/wofdk8e6uuy3/getting-to-know-elm)

## Admin?

Could potentially transition the Phoenix HTML to the "Admin" section and
use the Elm side as the user-facing application.
